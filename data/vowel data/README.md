The sound files in this folder were recorded 2020-2021 by Anna Persson & Maryann Tan at the Department of Swedish Language and Multilingualism, Stockholm University. The folder currently consist of sound files of recordings from 23 female L1 talkers of Swedish (Stockholm area).
Automatic textgrids were generated by a Swedish version of the Montreal Forced Aligner, developed by Young and McGarrah (2021). They were then hand-corrected by Anna Persson, following annotation procedures from the SweDia project (Engstrand, Bruce, Elert, Eriksson, & Strangert, 2001). Annotations of vowel quality was done in SweFAbet (Young, 2021). For four of the allophones, [œ], [œː], [æ], [æː], SAMPA was used ([œ]=9, [œː]=9:, [æ]={, [æː]={:).
