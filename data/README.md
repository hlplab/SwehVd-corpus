# Overview
This folder contains textgrids and sound files for the male and female talkers (vowel data/..) as well as raw extracted measurements (phonetic vowel statistics/Published databases/Persson-2023/raw-formant-data) and manually corrected measurements (phonetic vowel statistics/Published databases/Persson-2023/corrected-vowel-data). 

## Vowel data
The sound files in this folder were recorded 2020-2024 by Anna Persson & Maryann Tan at the Department of Swedish Language and Multilingualism, Stockholm University. The folder currently consist of sound files of recordings from 24 female L1 talkers and 20 male L1 talkers of Swedish (Stockholm area).

Automatic textgrids were generated by the Swedish version of the Montreal Forced Aligner, developed by Young and McGarrah (2021). They were then hand-corrected by Anna Persson, following annotation procedures from the SweDia project (Engstrand, Bruce, Elert, Eriksson, & Strangert, 2001). Annotations of vowel quality was done in SweFAbet (Young, 2021). For four of the allophones, [œ], [œː], [æ], [æː], SAMPA was used ([œ]=9, [œː]=9:, [æ]={, [æː]={:).

## Phonetic vowel statistics
This folder contains txt and csv files with vowel data of two types: 
1) Vowel data generated by the Praat vowel analyzer script (/raw-formant-data). 
2) Vowel data that has been measurement corrected by the Persson-2023-correction.rmd script (/corrected-vowel-data).
