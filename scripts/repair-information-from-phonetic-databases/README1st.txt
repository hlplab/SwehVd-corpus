This script adds or repairs information in the phonetic vowel database. For example, conduct outlier correction or add additional information, or change variable names. For manual correction of measurement errors in the SwehVd database, we decided to manually correct all identified outliers with a normalized density of less than .05. We first checked the segmentation boundaries in the Praat textgrids. Next, we manually measured new formant values using visual approximation of time points and Praat's function *Formant: Formant listing*. When the formant value generated diverged substantially from that talker's general value for that time point and that vowel, and/or the formant track did not follow a stable path in the spectrogram, the spectrogram was read manually by clicking the formant and reading off the value at the horizontal line. We then imported the corrected formant data for the outliers to overwrite the automatically obtained formants.
