# The SwehVd corpus
This is the repository of the Swedish vowel database *SwehVd*, a phonetically annotated corpus of Swedish h-VOWEL-d word recordings. SwehVd was collected with the goal to characterize the Central Swedish vowel space---specifically, the Stockholm variety---within and across talkers. Stockholm Swedish is a variety subsumed under Central Swedish---the regional standard variety of Swedish spoken in an area around and beyond Stockholm (eastern Svealand), including Mälardalssvenska, Sveamål, Uppsvenska, Mellansvenska [see e.g., @bruce2009; @elert1994; @riad2014]. The SwehVd targets the contemporary Central Swedish spoken in the larger Stockholm area. It covers the entire monophthong inventory of Central Swedish, including all nine long vowels (*hid*, *hyd*, *hud*, *hed*, *häd*, *höd*, *had*, *håd*, *hod*), eight short vowels (*hidd*, *hydd*, *hudd*, *hedd*, *hädd*, *hödd*, *hadd*, *hådd*, *hodd*), and four allophones (*härd*, *härr*, *hörd*, *hörr*). SwehVd consists of N=10 recordings of each hVd word (for a total of 210 recordings for the 21 different hVd words) per talker. 

We target N = 24 male and female talkers each (current N = 23, all female) for a total targeted N of tokens = 10,080 (current N = 4511 tokens). The database contains first to third formant (F1-F3) measurements for each talker at five time points across each vowel, together with vowel duration and mean F0 over the entire vowel.

For a more exhaustive description of the recording, processing and annotation process, please see Persson & Jaeger, 2023.

This repository contains sound files, textgrids, and a Praat script from which raw phonetic measurements were obtained, together with a rmd-file that reads in manually corrected measurement errors. We encourage all users to initialize git lfs (please see, https://git-lfs.github.com/), given that the repository contain large files (sound files in .wav format).
